# cog403project
Final Project for keystone course COG403 in Computational Cognitive Science Stream at the University of Toronto. Supervised under Dr. Yang Xu, with the help of TA's Jai and Jeremy. Special thanks to everyone involved -- Jai and Jeremy y'all are OP (and of course you too Dr. Xu!). Also special thanks to Melanie Davis with the Uoft Neurotech 2021 Club for letting us pick her brain about possible datasets and resources to learn preprocessing. 

Project focuses on classifying mild - moderate depression using a CNN and feeding EEG data. EEG data preprocessed with Python3 on jupyter notebook. EEG data for patients at rest (open eyes and closed eyes) was taken from J. Cavanagh's 2008 study published on the OpenNeuro database. All data was already semi-preprocessed by Cavanagh's team with a low-pass filter, epoched, and marked for events. Further preprocessing was needed to remove noise, deprecated channels, and visualize all events into topoplots for CNN preparation (raw .fif data files were missing, so vectorization was impossible).
